# Code for vim-2 project
The analyses are conducted on vim-2 dataset from Gallant Lab (https://crcns.org/data-sets/vc/vim-2).
Specifically, we performe analyses using the methods described in Wen et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03425). In detail, the code are for following analyses:
* cross-modal correlation for retinotopic mapping and hierarchical mapping (layer index mapping);
* Encoding model based on ridge regression and feature selection;
* visualization representation of each voxel using De-CNN.
